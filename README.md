# Weather-Application
The provided Python code implements a weather forecast application using the `OpenWeatherMap API` and `tkinter` library for creating a GUI. It consists of functions to fetch weather data `get_weather()` and display it `display_weather()`, along with a function to handle user interactions `get_weather_forecast()`. The GUI setup involves creating widgets for user input `city name` and a button to trigger the weather forecast retrieval. The application prompts users to enter a city name and upon clicking the button, fetches weather data from the API, displaying it in a message box. An error message is shown if the city is not found.
